# README

This is the repository for my dotfiles. To install on macOS:

## Configure GitHub

[Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

## Install dotfiles

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git just
git clone git@github.com:zerdaks/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles/
rm -f ~/.zprofile # stow will not overwrite a regular file
just stow
just zsh
exec zsh
just all # or `just --list` to pick recipes individually
```

Rerun `just stow` after adding a new file to the repo. Stow links files
individually, so a file it has never linked does not exist as far as anything
reading `~/.config` is concerned.

## Configure Neovim

```bash
vim
:lua vim.pack.update() # review the diff, then :write to apply or :quit to discard
:Mason # followed by shift-u to update all
:MasonInstall copilot-language-server jdtls
:LspCopilotSignIn
```

## Configure tmux

> System Settings &rarr; Keyboard &rarr; Keyboard Shortcuts... &rarr; Input Sources &rarr; Select the previous input source (uncheck)
