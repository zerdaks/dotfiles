# Proposals

Logged by /propose so it doesn't repeat itself. Change a status to accepted, rejected, or built.

- 2026-10-31 | built | Try Ghostty alongside WezTerm - add a ghostty recipe and a .config/ghostty/config that mirrors the six settings in .wezterm.lua, keeping WezTerm and its recipe untouched until one of them wins.
- 2026-10-31 | rejected | Fold the org-roam notes into the Obsidian vault - move the 26 notes in ~/orgfiles into ~/repos/notes as Markdown, then delete orgmode.lua, its require and the orgmode, org-bullets and org-roam lockfile entries, leaving obsidian.nvim as the one notes plugin.

- 2026-10-30 | built | Drop Homebrew's GNU make - remove the make formula from the nvim recipe and its gnubin PATH entry from .zprofile, and let the plugin builds use the GNU Make 3.81 that ships with the Command Line Tools.
- 2026-10-24 | rejected | Replace lazygit.nvim with a native terminal float - rewrite lazygit.lua so <leader>gl opens lazygit in a floating nvim terminal that closes and runs :checktime on exit, and drop the plugin and its lockfile entry.
- 2026-10-22 | rejected | Move lazygit from an nvim plugin to a tmux popup - bind prefix g in .tmux.conf to open lazygit in a popup at the pane's directory, and delete lazygit.lua, its require and its lockfile entry.
- 2026-10-22 | built | Make Mason the installer for Neovim-only tools - add custom/plugins/mason.lua that installs shfmt, buf, prettier, sql-formatter, goimports, jdtls and copilot-language-server, and drop them from the justfile brew lines, the vendored init.lua and the README :MasonInstall step.
- 2026-10-21 | built | Uninstall p7zip - remove the p7zip formula, whose 7z binary nothing has called since the unzip alias moved to sevenzip's 7zz, leaving one 7-Zip on PATH.
- 2026-10-17 | built | Keep mistyped commands out of history - add a zshaddhistory hook to .zshrc that refuses to save a line whose first word is not a command zsh can find (alias, function, builtin, or binary), so typos like `gti status` never reach ~/.zsh_history, and remove the hd alias and its history_delete function.
- 2026-10-17 | built | Drop vimtex and the latex recipe - delete vimtex.lua, its require and lockfile entry, and the latex recipe and its slot in `just all`, leaving TeX to ~/repos/fz-cv and ~/repos/docs, whose own install recipes already declare it.
- 2026-10-16 | rejected | Drop nvim-jdtls for lspconfig's jdtls - delete jdtls.lua, its require and ftplugin/java.lua, enable the jdtls config nvim-lspconfig already ships, and point <leader>i at the server's source.organizeImports code action; reverted: lspconfig's config breaks gd into JDK classes (no classFileContentsSupport or jdt:// handler).
- 2026-10-16 | rejected | Fish-style prefix history on Up/Down - bind the arrow keys in vi insert mode to zsh's built-in up/down-line-or-beginning-search widgets, so Up recalls only commands that start with what is already typed.
- 2026-10-15 | built | Drop trouble.nvim for native quickfix - delete trouble.lua and its require, and point <leader>xx at vim.diagnostic.setqflist so the key still opens a workspace-wide diagnostics list.
- 2026-10-14 | built | Replace nvim-autopairs with mini.pairs - delete autopairs.lua and its require, and enable mini.pairs from the mini.nvim that Kickstart already loads.
- 2026-10-13 | built | Add delta to lazygit's diff panel - install git-delta in the git recipe and set it as lazygit's diff renderer with the Catppuccin Mocha theme that bat already uses, leaving .gitconfig and terminal git output untouched.
- 2026-10-13 | built | Drop the Copilot CLI recipe - remove the copilot recipe from the justfile and uninstall the copilot-cli cask, leaving nvim's Copilot completions (Mason's copilot-language-server) untouched.
- 2026-10-11 | built | Drop fnm for Homebrew's Node - remove fnm from the zsh recipe and its init line from .zshrc, and use the Node that Homebrew already installs as a dependency of czg, prettier and sql-formatter.
- 2026-10-11 | built | Drop the PostgreSQL recipe - remove the postgres recipe (postgresql@18, its background service, pgcli) from the justfile and its PATH entry from .zprofile, and stop the orphaned server still running on this machine.
- 2026-10-11 | built | Drop the standalone Lua toolchain - remove the lua recipe (lua, luarocks) from the justfile and the ~/.luarocks/bin PATH entry from .zprofile, since nvim runs its own LuaJIT and the only rocks ever installed stopped working when Homebrew moved Lua to 5.5.
- 2026-10-11 | built | Drop hs for fzf's Ctrl-R - remove the fzf_history_search function and its hs alias from .zshrc, since fzf's own Ctrl-R history widget is already loaded.
- 2026-10-11 | rejected | Replace telescope-undo with built-in Undotree - remove telescope-undo.nvim and point <leader>u at nvim's own :Undotree.
- 2026-10-11 | built | Remove telescope-live-grep-args - delete the extension and its load_extension call from telescope.lua, since no keymap reaches it.
- 2026-10-11 | built | Stop brew-installing tools Mason already supplies - drop lua-language-server, stylua and shfmt from the justfile and uninstall the Homebrew copies, since nvim runs Mason's copies of all three.
- 2026-10-11 | built | Remove leap - delete leap.nvim and its s/S mappings, leaving the s keys to mini.surround.
- 2026-10-11 | built | Drop tpm and tmux-sensible - remove the tmux plugin manager and its only plugin, and set the five options and two key bindings it still contributes directly in .tmux.conf.
- 2026-10-11 | built | Replace bufferline with mini.tabline - remove bufferline.nvim and nvim-web-devicons and enable mini.tabline, which already ships in Kickstart's mini.nvim.
